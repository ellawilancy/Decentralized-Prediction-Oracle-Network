# Decentralized Prediction Oracle Network

A robust and secure oracle network that provides reliable off-chain data to blockchain applications through decentralized node operators and sophisticated consensus mechanisms.

## Overview

The Decentralized Prediction Oracle Network enables smart contracts to access real-world data through a network of independent node operators. The system ensures data accuracy through economic incentives, multi-source verification, and transparent dispute resolution.

## Core Components

### Data Feed Contract
- Aggregates data from multiple authorized node operators
- Implements sophisticated outlier detection algorithms
- Supports multiple data types and formats
- Maintains historical data records
- Provides emergency failover mechanisms
- Implements data quality scoring system

### Staking Contract
- Manages node operator security deposits
- Implements slashing conditions for malicious behavior
- Supports flexible staking periods
- Includes stake delegation functionality
- Provides stake withdrawal queuing system
- Features emergency unstaking mechanisms

### Dispute Resolution Contract
- Manages challenges to reported data
- Implements multi-round voting system
- Provides evidence submission framework
- Enforces resolution timeframes
- Handles stake slashing for proven misconduct
- Maintains dispute history for accountability

### Reward Distribution Contract
- Calculates rewards based on node performance
- Implements fair distribution algorithms
- Manages reward vesting schedules
- Provides automated payment processing
- Supports multiple reward tokens
- Features reward claim mechanisms

## Technical Requirements

- Ethereum-compatible blockchain
- Solidity ^0.8.0
- Node.js â‰¥16.0.0
- Hardhat or Truffle development framework
- Web3.js or ethers.js library
- OpenZeppelin contracts library

## Node Operator Guide

### Becoming a Node Operator

1. Meet minimum stake requirements
2. Deploy node infrastructure
3. Register as an operator
4. Pass validation period

### Operating Requirements

- Minimum 99.9% uptime
- Maximum 500ms response time
- Minimum stake: 50,000 tokens
- Valid data source APIs
- Secure key management system

## Smart Contract Integration

```solidity
interface IOracle {
    function getLatestData(bytes32 dataFeed) external view returns (uint256, uint256);
    function requestData(bytes32 dataFeed) external returns (uint256 requestId);
    function fulfillRequest(uint256 requestId, uint256 data) external;
}
```

## Security Features

- Multi-signature governance
- Time-delayed executions
- Automated security monitoring
- Stake slashing for malicious behavior
- Rate limiting mechanisms
- Emergency shutdown procedures

## Economic Model

- Node operator rewards: 70% of fees
- Protocol treasury: 20% of fees
- Dispute resolution pool: 10% of fees
- Minimum stake duration: 30 days
- Slashing penalties: Up to 100% of stake
